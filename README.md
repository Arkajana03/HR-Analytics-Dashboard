# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
This project presents a dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI to uncover key insights into employee behavior, attrition trends, and workforce demographics. Leveraging interactive visualizations, this dashboard enables HR managers and decision-makers to monitor and address human resource challenges more effectively.



# üîç Key Insights Provided:
Attrition Analysis: Tracks total attrition (237) with an overall attrition rate of 16.12%. Visuals break down attrition by department (R&D highest at 56.12%), age group, and education field, revealing that Life Sciences graduates and the 25‚Äì34 age group show the highest exit rates.

Employee Distribution: Provides a clear demographic breakdown by gender and age bands, with the majority of employees falling in the 25‚Äì44 age range. Gender segmentation helps assess diversity and identify groups most prone to turnover.

Performance Monitoring: Evaluates job role performance ratings across 8 job categories, helping identify low-performing sectors (e.g., Sales Executive has the highest headcount but also high 1- and 2-star ratings).

Workforce Snapshot: Includes critical KPIs such as total employees (1470), present employees (1233), and average employee age (37), helping HR track staffing health at a glance.
